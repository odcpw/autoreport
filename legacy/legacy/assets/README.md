# Assets

- `branding/` — default logos for left/right placement in reports.
- `icons/` — SVG/PNG icons used across the UI.
- `sample/` — optional demo photos for acceptance testing.

Keep exported assets lightweight; high-resolution photo fixtures should live outside version control unless explicitly required.
