I've successfully created Italian negative findings for all 34 Chapter 4 IDs (4.1.1 through 4.7.7), mirroring the German ID set from library_master.json. The findings are:

- **Concise negative statements** without "Se sì" clauses
- Based on Italian questions from the Excel file "Selbstbeurteilung Integrierte Sicherheit i.V14.xlsx"
- Matched to the German findings structure from library_master.json
- Organized by sections: 4.1 (Leaflets/directives), 4.2 (PPE necessity), 4.3 (PPE usage), 4.4 (Equipment operation), 4.5 (Work equipment maintenance), 4.6 (Building/facility maintenance), and 4.7 (Equipment procurement)

The list covers all IDs including 4.2.1 (which addresses the systematic definition of required PPE across all letter-suffix variants found in the Excel file).
