AutoBericht Project Template
============================

This folder is a clean project skeleton. For a new project:

1) Copy the `AutoBericht/` folder from the repo root into THIS folder.
   - Keep the name exactly `AutoBericht`.

2) Start the app:
   - Open AutoBericht\start-autobericht.cmd (double-click)

3) In the browser, click "Open Project Folder"
   - Select THIS project root folder.

4) Put photos into photos/ and customer inputs into inputs/.

5) Reports will be written to outputs/ (Word/PPT/PDF).

Notes
- project_sidecar.json and library_user_*.json will be created in this root.
- If we materialize photo views later, they will appear under photos/_views/...
- Templates (stored in project root):
  - Vorlage AutoBericht.pptx (PowerPoint)
  - Vorlage IST-Aufnahme-Bericht d.V01.docx (Word report template)
